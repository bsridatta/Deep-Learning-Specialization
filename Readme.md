**[Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) - Break into AI**
>Deep Learning is a superpower. With it you can make a computer see, synthesize novel art, translate languages, render a medical diagnosis, or build pieces of a car that can drive itself. If that isn’t a superpower, I don’t know what is.

Deep Learning Specialization, Course 5

**Disclaimer**
According to the code of honor, while I deeply respect, it is forbidden to opensource the solutions as it may effect the learning of the enrolled students and also the standards of the specialization itself. However this repository is to document my incredible experience, by just listing the Projects, Assignments and Quizzes that I completed as a part of the specialization. This does **not** contain any of the work itself.

## My Deep Learning journey started here!
